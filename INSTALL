You can use BUILD_CLI and BUILD_OBS_STUDIO variables to choose if you want
obs-cli and obs-studio as part of the project.

If building with BUILD_CLI=On boost is a dependency. As such, must install boost
and set its variables (like BOOST_ROOT and BOOST_LIBRARYDIR).

If building with BUILD_OBS_STUDIO=Off Qt5 is no longer necessary.
